# ðŸª„ napari-magic-wand

Object annotation in Napari using *magic wands* (shortest path algorithms). This plugin supports annotation in 2D (grayscale and RGB), 2D+t (grayscale, frame by frame) and 3D images (slice by slice). It can be used to annotate **paths** or the contour of solid objects.

The plugin provides two annotation functions:

- The **Magic wand** tool is based on the [PyIFT](https://github.com/PyIFT/pyift) library. Use it to trace annotations that follow the **intensity gradients** in the image.
- The **Brightest path** tool is based on the [Brightest Path Lib](https://github.com/mapmanager/brightest-path-lib) library. Use it to trace annotations that follow **the brightest (or darkest) path** between two points.

## Installation

You can install `napari-magic-wand` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-magic-wand

## Usage

- Select the tool of your choice from the `Plugins` menu of Napari.
- Open an image to annotate (2D, 2D+t, or 3D).
- Click on the button "Start live wire". A new `Labels` layer *Live wire (current edit)* should appear.
- Click on the image to annotate paths interactively.
- Double-click to confirm an annotation and move to the next.

**Options and parameters**
- *Close and fill objects*: You can fill (or not) the inside of the annotated object. Do not tick this option if you are annotating **paths** (e.g. filament-like strucutres).
- *Auto-increment label index*: Tick this option to increment the label index every time a new object is completed (e.g. if you are annotating multiple objects).
- *Sigma*: Higher values of sigma increase the "stickiness" of the object boundaries to the magic wand.
- *Black ridges*: Tick this checkbox if you are annotating dark paths on a bright background.
