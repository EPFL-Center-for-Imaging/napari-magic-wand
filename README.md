# ðŸª„ napari-magic-wand

Object annotation in Napari using a *magic wand* (shortest path algorithm). This plugin is based on the [PyIFT](https://github.com/PyIFT/pyift) library. This tool supports annotation in 2D (grayscale and RGB), 2D+t (grayscale, frame by frame) and 3D images (slice by slice). It can be used to annotate **paths** or solid objects via their contour.

Please also take a look at the [grabber-ift](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/grabber-ift) plugin, which offers similar functionality but slightly different user interactions.
